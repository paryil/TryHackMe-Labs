## Executive Summary
The primary objective of this project is to identify and assess injection vulnerabilities within a web application (OWASP Juice Shop). Injection vulnerabilities are critical security flaws that can lead to significant risks, including data loss and system downtime. There are several types of injection attacks, including:

SQL Injection: This occurs when an attacker inputs a malicious or malformed query to either retrieve or manipulate data from a database, and in some cases, gain access to accounts.

Command Injection: This happens when web applications execute input or user-controlled data as system commands. An attacker may exploit this by executing their own commands. An example of this can be seen in applications with misconfigured ping tests.

Email Injection: This vulnerability allows malicious users to send unauthorized email messages via the email server. This occurs when attackers add extra data to fields, which the server fails to interpret correctly.

## Scope: 
The project will focus on three main types of injection attacks: SQL Injection, Command Injection, and Email Injection. Each type of attack will be analyzed to understand its potential impact and to develop mitigation strategies.

# Methodology:

Identification: Detect potential injection points within the web application. This process involves examining inputs and outputs for errors, as most injection points trigger error messages.

SQL Injection: Evaluate the application's database interactions by attempting to input malicious or malformed queries. The goal is to determine if unauthorized data retrieval or tampering is possible.

Command Injection: Analyze how the application handles user input that is executed as system commands. This involves testing for vulnerabilities in functionalities, such as misconfigured ping tests.

Email Injection: Investigate the email functionalities to identify vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized email messages. This includes examining how the server interprets additional data fields.
