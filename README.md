# TryHackMe-Labs (Injection Vunerabilities)
Reporting a cybersecurity project involves several key steps to ensure that the information is clear, concise, and actionable. 
1. **Understand the Audience**: Know who will be reading the report (e.g., management, stakeholders, technical team) and tailor the content accordingly.
2. **Executive Summary**: Provide a brief overview of the project, including objectives, key findings, and recommendations.
3. **Project Overview**: Describe the scope of the project, including the goals, timeline, and resources involved.
4. **Methodology**: Explain the methods and tools used during the project, such as penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, or security audits.
5. **Findings**: Present the results of the project, detailing any vulnerabilities, risks, or security issues identified.
6. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the potential impact of the identified risks and prioritize them based on severity.
7. **Recommendations**: Offer actionable recommendations to address the identified risks and improve security posture.
8. **Conclusion**: Summarize the key points and reiterate the importance of implementing the recommendations.
9. **Appendices**: Include any additional information, such as detailed test results, logs, or technical data.

## Executive Summary
This task will focus on injection vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities pose significant risks to a company as they can lead to downtime and data loss. There are several types of injection attacks, including:

SQL Injection: This occurs when an attacker inputs a malicious or malformed query to either retrieve or manipulate data from a database, and in some cases, gain access to accounts.

Command Injection: This happens when web applications execute input or user-controlled data as system commands. An attacker may exploit this by executing their own commands. An example of this can be seen in applications with misconfigured ping tests.

Email Injection: This vulnerability allows malicious users to send unauthorized email messages via the email server. This occurs when attackers add extra data to fields, which the server fails to interpret correctly.
